Facial detection and recognition are among the most productive image processing applications and play an important role in the technical field. The recognition of human faces is an active issue for authentication purposes, particularly in the context of student attendance. An attendance system using face recognition is a method of recognizing students that uses face biostatistics based on high definition monitoring and other computer technologies. The development of this system is to achieve the digitization of the traditional system of taking attendance by calling names and maintaining pen-paper records, the current methods of taking attendance are tedious, time-consuming and they are easily manipulated by manual recording. The traditional process of making attendance and present biometric systems are vulnerable to proxies. The proposed system makes use of SVM, open-face and deep learning. This system generates and stores the attendance in excel format. The system will be tested under various conditions like illumination, head movements, the variation of distance between the student and cameras. and overall complexity and accuracy are calculated. The Proposed system proved to be an efficient and robust device for taking attendance in a classroom without any time consumption and manual work. The system developed is cost-efficient and needs less installation.
